### Description

This package contains the MathTool class and three demonstration programs to illustrate its usefullness including a simple scientific calculator, a simple expression solver, and a 2D graphing plot. The MathTool class included inputs a mathematical expression string (such as "1+1" or something like

"3*exp(4)/(cos(pi)-1)") and processes it through a totally cool algorythm that sorts the parts by operators and parenthesis. Same concept if you were to type a math problem into Google Search.
 
### More Info
 
Takes in a mathematical expression such as this:

3*exp(4)/(cos(pi)-1)

This is a really cool mathematical expression solver.

Would return -81.8972250497163 for the expression

3*exp(4)/(cos(pi)-1). You can easily program in more functions and the like, so it can make a really comprehensive scientific calculator.

May cause addiction, resulting in loss of sleep, abstinance from social interaction, malnutrition, poor hygiene, and even death.
